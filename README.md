### Golang tutorial



# Day 1:

1. Variable declaration
2. Constants
3. Derived Data types with `type` keyword
4. Enums 
5. Struct and member fields and methods
6. DuckTyping with Interfaces


# Day 2:

Assignment:   

main : 

1. Create an hrm struct -- employee package
2. Employee you pass it will return employee of that type: Factory Pattern with 3 structs we created. 

call constructors of 3 structs.
and call getDetails for all 3.

# Day 3:

1. Array and Slices
2. Map in golang
3. for...range
4. make keyword

# Day 4:
1. goroutines
2. channels 
3. buffered and unbuffered
4. communication using channels
5. Arrow operator to transfer data 


## assignment

 * pipeline pattern using goroutines
 * create a producer thread  -   write some values to a channel-1 say 1- 50
 * create a consumer-1 thread  -- consume the values from channel-1 , produce square of those values - put it into new channel-2
 * create a consumer-2 thread -- this prints the squared value form the channel-2

# Day 5:
1. Worker Pool using go routine
2. sync package wait group and mutexes

# Day 6:
1. Functional programming - Function is the first class citizen

# Day 7:
1. Select operation
2. Anonymous function and closures
