4. Enums 
5. Struct and member fields and methods
6. DuckTyping with Interfaces


# Day 2:

Assignment:

1. Create an hrm struct -- employee package

3. for...range
4. make keyword

# Day 4:
1. goroutines
2. channels 
3. buffered and unbuffered

5. Arrow operator to transfer data 


## assignment

 * pipeline pattern using goroutines
 * create a producer thread  -   write some values to a channel-1 say 1- 50
 * create a consumer-1 thread  -- consume the values from channel-1 , produce square of those values - put it into new channel-2
 * create a consumer-2 thread -- this prints the squared value form the channel-2

# Day 5:
1. Worker Pool using go routine
2. sync package wait group and mutexes
